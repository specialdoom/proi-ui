yet another Svelte ui library

## ðŸ“¢ Announcement: Public Archive ðŸ“¢

Dear community,

I would like to inform you that I have decided to create a public archive for the `proi-ui` library in its current state. Despite the availability of version 4, I believe that the library is not yet ready for production usage and may not be as complete as other existing libraries.

During the development period, I encountered some missing requirements and limitations that I was unable to address within the given timeframe. However, I have made significant efforts to upgrade the library as much as possible over the few months.

By creating a public archive, I aim to provide transparency and ensure that the community is aware of the current status of `proi-ui`. I encourage you to explore alternative libraries that may better suit your needs. For example:
 - [MeltUI](https://github.com/melt-ui/melt-ui)
 - [SkeletonLabs](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton)
 - [CarbonSvelte](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-svelte)

I appreciate your understanding and support as I will stop the development for the time being to focus on helping and contributing to other existing projects that are better suited for production usage. 

It was a great journey and a learning experience for me.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you,
